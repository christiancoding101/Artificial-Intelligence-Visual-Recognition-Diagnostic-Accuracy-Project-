# Create Your Own Image Classifier

This repository contains the Python code for the "Create Your Own Image Classifier" project. The objective of this project is to build a Python application capable of training an image classifier on a dataset, and then use the trained model to predict new images.

## Project Overview

The project enables users to train an image classifier with their own dataset and then use this classifier to predict image content. It's built using Python and integrates various machine learning libraries.

### Key Features

- Training an image classifier with a user-provided dataset.
- Predicting image content using the trained classifier.
- Customizable training parameters for the classifier.

### Files Description

- `train.py`: Script to train the image classifier.
- `predict.py`: Script to predict new images using the trained model.
- `train_functions.py`: Auxiliary functions for training the classifier.
- `predict_functions.py`: Auxiliary functions for making predictions.
- `Image Classifier Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the project's workflow.
- `Image Classifier Project.html`: HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook.
- `cat_to_name.json`: JSON file mapping category labels to names.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: [Specify necessary libraries and versions]

### Installation

To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone [Repository URL]
```

### Usage

1. **Training the classifier:**

   Run the `train.py` script with desired parameters. For example:

   ```
   python train.py data_directory
   ```

2. **Predicting with the classifier:**

   After training, use the `predict.py` script to make new predictions. For example:

   ```
   python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint
   ```
